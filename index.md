{: #link1 }

1.  Examiner mistakes/map OA to claimed invention elements
2.  Did they call a spade a spade?
3.  Claim comparison spreadsheet
4.  Review specification and see if want to pull anything from it not previously mentioned in the claims
5.  Prosecution history review
6.  Recommendations

## Presentation - Anticipation

How does the cited reference map to the claimed invention? Get the drawings up and go item by item. Steps 1 and 2 of your procedure but get the drawings side by side to present to the partner.

## Review Procedure - Obviousness

1. **All elements test**
    1. **See [Review Procedure - Anticipation steps 1 and 2](#link1)**
2. Commerical success
3. long felt need
4. Failure of others
5. Skepticism by experts
6. **Teaching away**
7. Copying by others
8. Synergistic effect - drastic unexpected result from the combination
9. Inoperable combination
10. Elements needd to be modified in order to combine and the mods are not found in the prior art
11. **TSM - Lack of TSM to combine in the art.**
    11. **Did the examiner provide a reasoned articulation?**

## Practical Tips

1. If the OA has a good number of allowed claims: ask the managing attorney to ask client if OK with moving forward with allowed claims. And file continuations for outstanding limitations. Helps avoid allowance withdrawals.

# Continuations

## Continuation Claim Set
1. Check if there are **already drafted claims in the provisional**.
2. Options if the cited art has ABCD --> draft ABCDE (tack on an element), ABCE (swap out an element), ABCEF (swap out and tack on an element)
3. Look in the specification of the parent for additional limittions ("Es") or better yet in the specification of the provisional.
4. Other tips:
    - To prevent design around, broaden claims in the continuation.
    - Draft broader claims in the continuation that you didn't claim in the parent and that are not in the cited art.
