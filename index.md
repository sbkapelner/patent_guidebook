# OFFICE ACTIONS

## Anticipation Review Procedure

1.  Examiner mistakes/map OA to claimed invention elements
2.  Did they call a spade a spade?
3.  Claim comparison spreadsheet
4.  Review specification and see if want to pull anything from it not previously mentioned in the claims
5.  Prosecution history review
6.  Recommendations

## Anticipation Presentation

How does the cited reference map to the claimed invention? Get the drawings up and go item by item. Steps 1 and 2 of your procedure but get the drawings side by side to present to the partner.

## Obviousness Review Procedure

1. **All elements test**
    1. **See [Review Procedure - Anticipation steps 1 and 2](#anticipation-review-procedure)**
2. Commerical success
3. long felt need
4. Failure of others
5. Skepticism by experts
6. **Teaching away**
7. Copying by others
8. Synergistic effect - drastic unexpected result from the combination
9. Inoperable combination
10. Elements needd to be modified in order to combine and the mods are not found in the prior art
11. **TSM - Lack of TSM to combine in the art.**
12. **Did the examiner provide a reasoned articulation?**

## Final Office Actions

Option 1: Bolster your previous arguments from the Response to the Non-Final Office Action if you think the Examiner was outrageously wrong.

Option 2: Bolster your argument on appeal. This is the best option if you are making the same argument as in the Response to the Non-Final Office Action.
*It may not look good to client to file an appeal in every case.

Option 3: Amend the claims.

## Practical Tips

1. If the OA has a good number of allowed claims: ask the managing attorney to ask client if OK with moving forward with allowed claims. And file continuations for outstanding limitations. Helps avoid allowance withdrawals.

# DRAFTING

## Application Drafting Steps

1. Do not write claims first! Make Figures.
2. Write the Detailed Description i.e. describe the Figures
    - A monolith can be overwhelming. Create a separate file for each Figure and they copy and paste into the monolith.
3. Draft the claims.
    - Identify claim categories.
    - Scan the specification from top to bottom for each category.
4. Write the Summary as the claims written in prose.
5. Write the Abstract as the broadest claim written in prose and cut down to 150 words.

## General Claim Drafting

1. At least one vs. one or more
    - "corresponding" can be used to refer back to the "one or more" with less words
2. A first widget in claim 1, a second widget in claim 2 is easier to read than "one or more"
3. If you use a nonce term ("element", "member", "processor", etc.), you need to put several examples of what that means in the specification.
4. Be careful because "Functional claim language that is not limited to a specific structure covers all devices that are capable of performing the recited function. Therefore, if the prior art discloses a device that can inherently perform the claimed function, a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102 and/or 35 U.S.C. 103 may be appropriate." MPEP 2114.

## Types of Claim Sets

1. US
    - 20 claims
2. PCT
    - Copy the U.S. claim set
    - Convert to multiple dependent form ("The widget of any of claims 1 - n-1" if the dependent claim n depends from claim 1 and is not the first dependent claim to appear in the claim set)
3. EPO
    - 15 claims
    - Multiple dependent form OK and encouraged

## Continuation Claim Set

1. Check if there are **already drafted claims in the provisional**.
2. Options if the cited art has ABCD --> draft ABCDE (tack on an element), ABCE (swap out an element), ABCEF (swap out and tack on an element)
3. Look in the specification of the parent for additional limittions ("Es") or better yet in the specification of the provisional.
4. Other tips:
    - To prevent design around, broaden claims in the continuation.
    - Draft broader claims in the continuation that you didn't claim in the parent and that are not in the cited art.

## Continuation In Part

## Drawings

- To avoid getting a Notice to File Missing Parts all callouts in the drawings must be in the specification and vice versa.

# NATIONAL STAGE FILINGS OF PCT APPLICATIONS

## Patent Prosecution Highway

- The examiner in subsequent countries of filing is not (rarely) going to look at references cited by examiner in OFF (Office of First Filing).

## PPH Requirements by Country

| Country           | Timing for Request                                                                             | Claim Scope                                                    |

Foreign counsel recommends adding independent claims from pending US CON or DIVs              |

# Freedom to Operate

## How to Read a Patent or Patent Application

1. Grab the EPO INPADOC report for patent family information and Latest Legal Events.
![Espacenet Screenshot](/patent_guidebook/assets/images/Espacenet.png)
2. Grab the Patent Public Search report first page and note the continuity data.
3. Print the Figures.
4. Read the Abstract and Background.
5. Read the Detailed Description and label the Figures.
6. Read the broadest claim and summarize in laymans terms what they are getting.

## Infringement Analysis

- Make a chart of claims vs client's product but annotate what each of the claim terms mean in light of the specification. Make a word doc and then and then save it as a PDF and add annotations in the left (claims) column stating what each term means and where to find a more detailed explanation in the specification.

## Invalidity Analysis

1. Read the PCT preliminary report on patent ability if applicable. Use the references from this. If you donâ€™t have this, I guess you have to use the references cited during prosecution history.  
2. Make a claim chart. In the right column of the claim chart try to invalidate the claim.
3. Make a summary table of references relied upon and each claims status (102 or 103 or None)

# BILLING

- Office Action Response = $3,000 - $3,200 (for experienced attorney)
    - If you are going to exceed this ask the billing attorney permission to bill more.
    - If you are the billing attorney, confer with the client.

***

# MISCELLANEOUS

## Partner Emails

1. Ask how long should this take me?
2. Ask when do you need this by?

## Partner Calls

1. Open with this is case number: 12345 (matter id)
2. No files on mac --> will likely need to share screen

## Foreign Associate Correspondance

1. Things you will likely have them prepare:
    - Voluntary Amendments
    - PPH request
2. Look at the U.S. allowed claims and use for the voluntary amendments.
    - Verify that there are no antecedent basis problems with the U.S. allowed claims because I have seen this happen.
3. If you ask for a PPH request, attach the Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Application to the email.
